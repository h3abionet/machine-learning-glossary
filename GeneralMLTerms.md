| Spervised Learning                | A subclass of machine learning in which a desired model predicts the label for yet-unseen data. A training dataset with known outcome is used, and the relationship between a set of predictors (independent variables, risk factors) and the outcome is modelled. The model can then be tested on a test data set and improved for maximum prediction. The resulting model is then used to predict the outcome of new data sets.Examples include [Linear regression](), [Logistic regression](), [Decision tree](), [Support Vector Machines](), [Naïve Bayes](), [K-Nearest Neighbours](), [Random Forest](), [Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms](), [Gradient Boosting Algorithms](), [Neural Networks]() & [Association Rules]().                                                                     |
| Unsupervised Learning             | A subclass of machine learning in which a desired model finds hidden (or latent) structure in data. It is used where there is no target or outcome variable to predict, and the primary aim is to identify clusters (or stratify) the items in a dataset according to specific features or characteristics. The computer learns to identify patterns in the data without human guidance about how the different clusters should be determined. Examples include [Clustering](), [Neural Networks]() and [Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms]().                                                                                                                           |
| Semi-supervised Learning          | A subclass of machine learning which falls between supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, where only a subset of the data are labelled – so that where data are unlabelled, their features may still contribute understanding about the group parameters. Exmples include [Generative Models](), [Low-Density Separation](), [Graph-Based Methods]() and [Change of Representation]()                                                                                                                        |
| Reinforcement Leanring            | A subclass of machine learning which is used to train a machine to make specific decisions and then continually improve this process through trial-and-error – learning from past experience and capturing knowledge to improve decision-making. The reinforcement learning algorithm (or agent) learns iteratively from experience, with feedback that acts as the reinforcement signal to modify the algorithm’s behaviour. Examples include [Q-Learning](), [Temporal Difference]() and [Deep Adversarial Networks]()      |
|        Learning        | In a modeling problem, learning refers to running a computer program to investigate the characteristics of the data and build a model based on a a training dataset or past experience. The program is shown a set of data, including input with the expected output, and the associated output defined as “good”|
