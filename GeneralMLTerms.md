| Spervised Learning                | A subclass of machine learning in which a desired model predicts the label for yet-unseen data. A training dataset with known outcome is used, and the relationship between a set of predictors (independent variables, risk factors) and the outcome can be modelled. The model can then be tested on a test data set and improved for maximum prediction. The resulting model is then used to predict the outcome of new data sets.                                                                                       |
