| Spervised Learning                | A subclass of machine learning in which a desired model predicts the label for yet-unseen data. A training dataset with known outcome is used, and the relationship between a set of predictors (independent variables, risk factors) and the outcome can be modelled, and then tested on a test set as well as used to predict the outcome where it is not known                  |
