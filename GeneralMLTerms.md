| Spervised Learning                | A subclass of machine learning in which a desired model predicts the label for yet-unseen data. A training dataset with known outcome is used, and the relationship between a set of predictors (independent variables, risk factors) and the outcome is modelled. The model can then be tested on a test data set and improved for maximum prediction. The resulting model is then used to predict the outcome of new data sets.Examples include [Linear regression](), [Logistic regression](), [Decision tree](), [Support Vector Machines](), [Na√Øve Bayes](), [K-Nearest Neighbours](), [Random Forest](), [Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms](), [Gradient Boosting Algorithms](), [Neural Networks]() & [Association Rules]().                                                                     |
| Unsupervised Learning             | A subclass of machine learning in which a desired model finds hidden (or latent) structure in data. It is used where there is no target or outcome variable to predict, and the primary aim is to identify clusters (or stratify) the items in a dataset according to specific features or characteristics. The computer learns to identify patterns in the data without human guidance about how the different clusters should be determined. Examples include [Clustering](), [Neural Networks]() and [Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms]().                                                                                                                           |
