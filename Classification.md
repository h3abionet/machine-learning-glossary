Classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, based on a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is already known. It is a computational means for reducing the amount of information. The input is information-rich sequence data, and the output may be a single number or, in the simplest case, a yes or no representing a choice between  categories. Examples include (1)distinguishing healthy patients from sick patients, based on gene expression profiles (2) classification of unlabelled DNA sequences using previously labeled sequences and (3) phylogenetic reconstruction where we organize a family of sequences into subclasses.
