We aim to develop a machine learning terms glossary introducing the ML jargon and explaining it using very simple terms and including examples from the bimoedical research field. <br/> 
We beleive this Glossary will help folks from non computing background get familiar with ML terms and methods in order to enhance the use of  ML to answer biological questions. <br/>  
This glossary includes [general ML terms](https://github.com/h3abionet/machine-learning-glossary/blob/master/GeneralMLTerms.md) and terms specific to different catergories of ML.
