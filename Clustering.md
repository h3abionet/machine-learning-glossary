Clustering consists of partitioning a set of elements into subsets according to the differences between them. In other words, it is the process of grouping similar elements together into clusters. The main difference from the supervised classification is that, in clustering, we have no information about how many classes there are. A good clustering result maximises homogeneity between intra group and  separability between the different groups. 

Example in bioinformatics
Clustering of genes in expression data - In RNA-seq experiments we obtain the expression value for thousands of genes in a few samples. An interesting insight that we can extract from this data is which genes are co-expressed in the different samples.  This is a clustering problem where genes with similar expression levels in all samples are grouped into a cluster.
